# ECE385
Coursework and final project for the fall 2015 session of ECE385: Microprocessor Systems. All code is Nios II assembly.
 
 Labs 2 and 3 are somewhat simple work that deals with basic assembly concepts; looping, using the stack and memory, and interacting with C.
 
 Lab 4 is a project that uses external hardware; in this case a controller for lego sensors and motors with the goal of creating a self balancing unicycle.
 
 The final project is "Space Escapers", an arcade-like game inspired by Space invaders. The player pilots a ship at the top of the screen and tries to shoot aliens trying to flee earth. This was written entirely in assembly.
